Find files
----------
hs-ls tev100pp_higgs_ttbar_mg5     # list files with the name tev100_higgs_ttbar_mg5
hs-ls tev100pp_ttbar_mg5%rfast001  # list events for the reconstraction tag rfast001
hs-find higgs                      # find samples with the word "higgs"

Downloads:
---------
hs-get tev100pp_ttbar_mg5 data     # download EVGEN files to "data" 
hs-get tev100pp_ttbar_mg5%rfast001 # download fast simulations for this sample 

View: 
----
hs-view file.promc [or URL]      # look at the event record using GUI 
hs-meta file.promc [or URL]      # meta information 


Run over EVGEN files: 
-------------------
hs-run  test.py                  # run Jython script "test.py" in a batch mode
hs-ide  test.py    [or URL]      # open script "test.py" in IDE and run it
